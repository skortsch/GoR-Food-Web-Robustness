This repo contains data and code for running the analyses performed in the manuscript "Food web robustness depends on the network type and threshold for extinction" by Patrik P.G. Ståhl, Riikka Puntila-Dodd, Lai Zhang, Marie C. Nordström and Susanne Kortsch.
Through simulating node extinctions in the Gulf of Riga (GoR) food web, we quantified how food web robustness is influenced by network type (unweighted/weighted interactions), network properties (complexity and skewness), and thresholds for species extinction.
